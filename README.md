The **DerBnb** project started as a entrant in dArch Event 0. 

During that event **derbnbDesktop** development commenced and the project was collaborated upon by event participants. 

Written in Go and using [Fyne Toolkit](https://fyne.io/), derbnbDesktop is built on Dero's private L1. Powered by [Gnomon](https://github.com/civilware/Gnomon) and [dReams](https://github.com/dReam-dApps/dReams) packages, derbnbDesktop gives owners and renters a new way to facilitate property management and rental requests in a private manner.

As well as being its own application, the derbnbDesktop package can be imported for use in other Go/Fyne applications. Currently derbnbDesktop is featured as a dApp in [dReams], and DerBnb currently has a web app in development.
